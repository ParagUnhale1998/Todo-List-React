# Here i Create a Robo Search app Using React
```
Here Is The Simple Explainations of This Code For New One !
```
1)  The code is a simple Todo List application built using React.
2)  The application allows users to add tasks to a list and mark them as complete.
3)  The App component is the main component that renders the Todo List.
4)  The useState hook is used to manage the state of the input text and the list of items.
5)  The useEffect hook is used to load the items from local storage when the component mounts.
6)  The handleInput function updates the inputText state based on the user's input.
7)  The addItems function adds the input text as a new item to the list when the form is submitted.
8)  The deleteItem function removes an item from the list when the user marks it as complete.
9)  The TodoItems component represents an individual item in the list. It has a checkbox to mark the item as complete and a button to delete the item.
10) The list of items is rendered using the map function, creating a TodoItems component for each item in the list.
